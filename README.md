In each rule function 
  If the unread input is empty
  
  While loop condition is unread input is empty
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  Main{
    final = ;
    take input;
    step = 0;
    state = p;
    stack read = stack(NULL);
    stack unread = stack(UNREAD INPUT)
    while(state != NULL && state != final){
      rule = applyRules(state, read, unread)
    }
  }
  
  
  applyRules(state, read, unread){
      rule = findRules();
      applyrule   
  }
  
  FindRules
  
  ApplyRule1{
    pop
    push 
    set state
    print line
  }
