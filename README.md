# PDA-Project

Language L = {an bn | n >= 0}
generated by context free grammar G = ({a,b,S}, {a,b}, R, S)
  where R contains rules S->aSb and S->e
The resulting PDA is 
  M1 = ({p,q,qa,qb,q$}, {a,b}, {a,b,S}, rules, p, {q$})
  where rules =
      1 
 

Using 2 stacks, unread input and read input.
Main -> fuction takes 3 inputs -> returns rule used -> apply rule in separate function -> print line

In each rule function 
  If the unread input is empty
  
  While loop condition is unread input is empty
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  Main{
    final = ;
    take input;
    step = 0;
    state = p;
    stack read = stack(NULL);
    stack unread = stack(UNREAD INPUT)
    while(state != NULL && state != final){
      rule = applyRules(state, read, unread)
    }
  }
  
  
  applyRules(state, read, unread){
      rule = findRules();
      applyrule   
  }
  
  FindRules
  
  ApplyRule1{
    pop
    push 
    set state
    print line
  }
